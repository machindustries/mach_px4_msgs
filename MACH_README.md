# Mach's Custom px4_msgs

This repository is intended to break out the custom message definitions from [our fork of PX4](https://github.com/machindustries/px4/) into ROS2 package suitable to be submoduled into a workspace.

A CI pipeline in the PX4 repo monitors for changes and synchronizes them here when needed.
